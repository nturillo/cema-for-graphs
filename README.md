# Cross entropy method for constructing graphs
This is a fork of code used for a paper titled "Reinforcement learning for graph theory, I. Reimplementation of Wagner's approach."

I've built on top of that paper's model to try to find a counterexample to a conjecture about graph gonality and genus.
Specifically, the conjecture is that
$gon(G) \leq \frac{gen(G) + 3}{2}$
where $gon(G)$ and $gen(G)$ are the gonality and genus of a graph $G$, respectively.
